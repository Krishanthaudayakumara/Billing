# Ethereal - Billing System

Ethereal Billing System is meant to be used as a personal alternative to WHMCS. In no way is this as good or even better than WHMCS apart from the fact that is free and open source to the public. 
I used to run a variety of different hosting companies that used CPanel. I created this billing system so that I can manage client websites for my freelance side hustle while also having an intiutive user friendly design for them.

You are free to take this and use it as a base for your personal needs, hosting companies and so on. I do not mind. This is a work in progress website application so please expect bugs and lack of features.
